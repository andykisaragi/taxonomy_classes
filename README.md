taxonomy_classes
================

taxonomy_classes drupal module

adds body classes for terms within specified vocabularies, when either viewing a matching term or a node tagged with one. also has an option to pull terms from nodes referenced in entityreference fields.

elsewhere people say "just use context!" but to me that seems silly if this is the only thing you're using context for. massive overkill and extra CMS clutter. ( https://www.drupal.org/node/1072806 / https://www.drupal.org/node/1257822 )
